## 🛠️ Update Formation Workflow in uMini, uStandard, and uSuite Projects

In the Linux Mative ecosystem, all updates follow a clear and logical sequence. This ensures system stability while allowing new features to be introduced and tested flexibly.

### 🔁 Update Sequence

1. **Base Script: uMini**  
   All updates start with **uMini**, which serves as the foundation for all other build scripts, including **uStandard** and **uSuite**. Core changes and improvements are first implemented here.

2. **Test Versions: RC (Release Candidate)**  
   Distributions that include the scripts will also feature versions marked **RC** — these are test versions meant for evaluating new features and changes before they are merged into the main script.  
   RC versions allow community members to try out new features early and help identify potential issues.

3. **Updating uStandard**  
   Based on the updated uMini, the **uStandard** script is formed. It goes through the same RC stage, and once testing is complete, the changes are merged into the stable version.

4. **Forming uSuite**  
   Once the stable version of uStandard is ready, the **uSuite** script is created. It follows the same process: RC version first, then the main release.

### 📌 Benefits of This Approach

- Minimizes bugs through staged testing.
- Provides early access to features via RC versions.
- Ensures clear structure and continuity between builds.
