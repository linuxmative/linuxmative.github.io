# About Linux Mative

**Linux Mative** is an open and modular Linux-based system designed with simplicity and freedom in mind.  
Our philosophy is: *Start with a terminal, build your system from scratch.*  

This project was born from the idea that users should have full control over their operating environment, with no unnecessary components, only what is truly needed. Whether you're running it on old hardware or modern machines, Linux Mative aims to provide a lightweight, stable, and customizable foundation to build on.

Key features of the Linux Mative ecosystem include:

- ‚öôÔ∏è **uMini** ‚Äî A minimal Ubuntu-based system for power users and tinkerers.  
- üñ•Ô∏è **uStandard** ‚Äî A balanced setup ready for desktop use without bloat.  
- üß∞ **uSuite** ‚Äî An advanced toolkit and installer for configuring full desktop environments.

This site is maintained and built using **Jekyll**, and all code is hosted openly on [GitHub](https://github.com/linuxmative). Contributions, feedback, and ideas are always welcome.

# About the Author

My name is **Maksym Titenko** ‚Äî I'm an independent developer and system customizer.

I've been passionate about Linux, open-source software, and lightweight systems for years.  
This project reflects my personal journey through customization, performance tuning, and minimalist computing.

I created **Linux Mative** not only as a toolkit for myself but as a contribution to the broader Linux community.  
I believe users should have the freedom to build what they need ‚Äî with clarity, efficiency, and no corporate noise.
